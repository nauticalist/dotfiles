dwm - dynamic window manager (grufwub's fork)
=============================================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

It comes with shortcuts added for volume and brightness
modification, by calling PulseAudio and Xbacklight respectively.
Also adds controllable Window transparency via transset-df and
Xcompgr (feature added using suckless' default-transparency
patch).


Requirements
------------
In order to build grufwub's dwm you need the Xlib header files. 
To run, you need PulseAudio (for volume control), xbacklight
(for display brightness control), transset-df and Xcompmgr
(for window transparency setting).


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by modifying config.h
and (re)compiling the source code. To set your brightness / volume
modifier keys, edit the defined values in config.h using values
obtained from 'xmodmap -pk'.
